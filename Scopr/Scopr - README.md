# Scopr
A scoping tool to create a todo list from a tickbox template.

## Background
I created this tool to help me scope out projects. I wanted to be able to create a list of tasks that I could then tick off as I completed them. I also wanted to be able to create a list of tasks that I could then use to create a Gantt Chart.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release of the relevant application.
2. Open the HTML file in your browser of choice.
3. Use the application.

## Features
- No installation required
- Works on any computer
- Works from a USB Drive
- Offline Friendly

## Roadmap

### Planned Functionality
- Multiple Themes

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some may be necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

### Current Dependencies
- None

### Previous Dependencies
- None
