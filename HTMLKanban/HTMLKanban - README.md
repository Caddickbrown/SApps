# HTMLKanban
A simple, markdown-based Kanban App contained in a single HTML File.

## Background
I wanted a simple kanban app that I didn't need to install. I also wanted to be able to use it on any computer, even from a USB Drive.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release.
2. Open `HTMLKanban.html` in your browser of choice.
3. Write.
4. Copy/Export as required.
5. Enjoy!

## Features
- Drag-and-drop for cards
- Themes
- Settings modal functionality
- Export to and import from Markdown

## Changing the Default Theme
To change the default theme you just need to "uncomment" out the theme you want and comment out any others within the HTML file.
- Open the HTML file in your text editor of choice.
- Hit Ctrl+F and Search for "Config"
- Find the section that lists the different options (such as "default" or "sepia")
- Comment out the themes that you don't want by putting "//" in front of them.
- Remove the "//" from the theme you would like to be your default.
- Save the file.
- Test
- Enjoy!
