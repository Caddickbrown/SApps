# HTMLWriter Compression
A slight spin off with the project to investigate filesizes and compressing it while keeping it as functional as the "full" and "readable" version.

It is not intended to be an easily "readable" file, but to reduce the filesize as much as possible.

It uses v3.0.0 of the file. Has all comments and space removed.
