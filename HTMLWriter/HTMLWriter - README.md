# HTMLWriter
A simple, markdown-based Writer App contained in a single HTML File.

## Background
I wanted a simple writing app that I didn't need to install. I also wanted to be able to use it on any computer, even from a USB Drive.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release.
2. Open `HTMLWriter.html` in your browser of choice.
3. Write.
4. Copy/Export as required.
5. Enjoy!

## Features
- Dark/Light Mode
- Insert Date Button
- Formatting Buttons (Bold, Italics, Underline)
- txt Export Button
- Copy Button

## Roadmap

### Planned Functionality
- Multiple Themes
- Focus Mode
- SApp Standardisation
- Version Number as Variable
- Standardised Footer
- Line Numbers

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some may be necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

### Current Dependencies
- None

### Previous Dependencies
- None
