# CFiler
CFiler is an offshoot of Journaller and Postage.

The idea being that you have a folder of HTML files/journal entries and you have a contents page of sorts that links to each of the files.

## Files and Folders
- `CFiler.py` - The Python script that generates the HTML file.
- `Contents.html` - The generated HTML file.
- `Library` - The folder that contains the HTML files to "Group".

## How to use
1. Create a folder with an "Library" folder with your HTML files in it.
2. Copy the Python script into the parent folder.
3. Run the Python script.
4. Open the generated HTML file in your browser.
5. Browse as you wish.

## How it works
The Python script will look for all HTML files in the "Library" folder and then generate a HTML file with links to each of the files.

## Roadmap

I may add a way to generate a "blog" style page with the most recent entries at the top. I may also add a way to generate a "wiki" style page with links to other pages.
