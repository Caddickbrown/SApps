# PostBuildr
PostBuildr is a simple tool that allows you to take a Markdown template for a blog post and convert it into a blog post HTML page using Python.

## Background

I wanted to create a blog, but I didn't want to have to write HTML for every post. I also wanted to be able to write the posts in Markdown, as I find it easier to write in Markdown than HTML. I also wanted to be able to write the posts in a text editor, rather than in a web browser.

## Usage
- Download the latest release.
- Fill Out the Markdown Template with your post and metadata.
- Run the PostBuildr.py file
    - This will generate your HTML file and rest the template file.
- Use your outputted HTML as you see fit

## Features
- Markdown to HTML Conversion
- Metadata Parsing

## Roadmap

### Planned Functionality
- Customisable Metadata
- Customisable Markdown Template
- Customisable Template

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some may be necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

### Current Dependencies

- Python
- [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/)
- [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/)

### Previous Dependencies
- None
