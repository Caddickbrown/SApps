# ExApps
ExApps (Exception Apps) are a collection of Apps that don't fit the single page philosophy. They are however tangentially related to the main project and can be used with or alongside other SApps. This is almost a "catchall" for anything that can't be included in the main project.

Where possible I will try to keep them as close to SApps as I can - however some may require other dependencies.

## Usage
Each ExApp has its own README file with instructions on how to use it.
1. Download the latest release of the relevant application.

## Features
- Minimal Installations Required
- SApp Compatibility
- Standardised Template

## Apps
### CFiler
CFiler is an offshoot of Journaller and Postage. It collates a folder of HTML files into a single HTML file with links to each of the files as a kind of "Contents" page.

It uses `Python` to generate the HTML file.

### PostBuildr
PostBuildr is a simple tool that allows you to take a Markdown template for a blog post and convert it into a blog post HTML page. It is an offshoot of Postage with a slightly different use method.

It uses `Python` to generate the HTML file.

### Archivr
Archivr is a simple tool that allows you to take a folder of files on a USB Stick and archive them into a folder on your local computer. It is an offshoot of Journaller, Postage, and CFiler in an effort to speed up archiving files from a USB Stick.

It uses `Python` to move the files.

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some may be necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

## Contributing
