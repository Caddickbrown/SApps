# Archivr
Archivr is a simple tool that pulls any files from a directory in a USB stick and pastes them into a set directory on a computer. This can be used for archiving files from a USB stick to a known computer quickly and easily.

## Background
I wanted to create an offline Journal on a USB Stick, but didn't want to manually pull files into a folder each time I wanted to archive them.

## Usage
- Download the latest release.
- Run the Archivr.py file
    - This will Archive your files onto your computer and move them to an Archive Folder on the USB Stick.
    - The files can be set to delete immediately after copying, or to remain on the USB Stick in the Archive Folder.

## Features
- Quick Archiving into a known folder
- Customisable Archive Folder Location
- Customisable File Deletion

## Roadmap

### Planned Functionality

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some may be necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

- [Python-OS](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
- [Pyton-Shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html)
