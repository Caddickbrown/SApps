# CounTally
A simple tally counter for the web.

## Background
I wanted a simple tally counter that I could use on my phone and on my computer. Putting together a Swift App for iPhone was an option, but it's not as cross-platform as I'd like.

I decided to build a simple web app that I could use on my phone and on my computer.

## Usage
1. Download the files
2. Open `CounTally.py` in your browser
3. Click the buttons to count up or down.

## Features
- Count up or down
- Reset count to 0

## Roadmap

### Planned Features
- Change count by any amount
- Manually Edit Count
- Save and Store Multiple Counts (How this works with HTML, I'm not currently sure)
- Daily Counts
- Weekly Counts
- Monthly Counts
- Yearly Counts
- Reporting
- Themes

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some may be necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

### Current Dependencies
- None

### Previous Dependencies
- None
