# SAppTemplate
A Template Repo for Single Page Apps.

## Background
As I built more SApps, I found that I needed a template that gave me basic functionality to all of the different SApps. Dark Mode being a good example, where the code and functionality should be the same and standardised. I created this template repo to help me get started with new projects.

An SApp Template Update could be akin to an "OS" Update. It will bring new features and functionality to all SApps easily.

## Usage
This repo is a template repo, so you can use it to create a new repo with all of the files and folders in this repo. It can then be edited to create the actual SApp Page.

The SApp Template Version also tells me something about what functionality the SApp has and what needs patching in.
