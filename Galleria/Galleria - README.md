# Galleria
Galleria is a simple image gallery for Base64 encoded images.

## Background
I wanted to make a simple gallery app that could be opened from a USB stick. I wanted to be able to view the images in a simple, clean way. I also wanted to be able to view the images in a slideshow format.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release.
2. Open `Galleria.html` in your browser of choice.
3. Enjoy the images!

## Features
- Simple, Clean Design
- Slideshow
- Dark/Light Mode
- Autoscrolling Gallery

## Roadmap
### v2.0.0
- [ ] Image Uploading

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some are necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

### Current Dependencies
- None
