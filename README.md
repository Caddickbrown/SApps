# Postage

## Description
Postage is a SInple-Page HTML App app that generates an HTML page from a Markdown-based input form.

The user enters markdown text into an input box and the app generates an HTML page from the input.

## Background
I wanted a quick way to create a simple HTML page from a template and markdown input. I couldn't find anything that fit my needs, so I made my own.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release.
2. Open `Postage vx.0.html` in your browser of choice.
3. Fill out the form.
4. Click the export button.
5. Enjoy your exported file!
