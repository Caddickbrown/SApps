An attempt to make a quick and accessible way to get a journal prompt on command.

Was looking to make something that can work on any computer - even from a USB Drive. Something that doesn't need to be installed, Web Browsers are pretty ubiquitous so seemed a good way to go.

The hope was that it would be a self contained file with everything in place and doesn't need to link to anything else. There is some formatting in there as well though - I added a font, but itâ€™s more of an optional extra.

Functionally it seems to work well, I even added a copy button for easy transferring to a journal or other file.
