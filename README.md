# Journal Prompter

>[!note]
>This project needs standardising with other current projects.

Journal Prompter is a simple HTML file that generates a random journal prompt on command.

The user clicks a button and the app generates a random prompt from a list of prompts. The app is designed to be as lightweight as possible.

The hope was that it would be a self contained file with everything in place and doesn't need to link to anything else. There is some formatting in there as well though - I added a font, but itâ€™s more of an optional extra.

Functionally it seems to work well, I even added a copy button for easy transferring to a journal or other file.

## Background
I wanted a quick way to get a journal prompt on command, from a file that doesn't require installation, and that could work on any computer - even from a USB Drive. I couldn't find anything that fit my needs, so I made my own.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release.
2. Open `JP_vx.x.html` in your browser of choice.
3. Click the button to get a prompt
4. Click the copy button to copy the prompt to your clipboard
5. Paste the prompt into your journal or other file

## Features
- Randomly generates a prompt from a list
- Copy to clipboard button
- 550+ prompts!
- No installation required

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some may be necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

- TBC
