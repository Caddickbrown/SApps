# Journal Prompter

>[!note]
>This project needs standardising with other current projects.

Journal Prompter is a simple HTML file that generates a random journal prompt on command.

## Background
I wanted a quick way to get a journal prompt on command, from a file that doesn't require installation, and that could work on any computer - even from a USB Drive.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release.
2. Open `JP_vx.x.html` in your browser of choice.
3. Click the button to get a prompt.
4. Click the copy button to copy the prompt to your clipboard.
5. Paste the prompt into your journal or other file.

## Features
- Randomly generates a prompt from a list
- Copy to clipboard
- 550+ prompts
- No installation required
- Works on any computer
- Works from a USB Drive

## Future
### v3.0
- [ ] Cleaner Style
- [ ] Dark/Light Mode
- [ ] Aesthetic Standardisation
- [ ] Version Number as a Variable
- [ ] Colours as Variables

### Planned Functionality
- Cleaner Aeresthetics
- Dark/Light Mode Toggle
- Custom Themes
- Custom Prompts

### Export Options
- Copy to Clipboard

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some may be necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

### Current Dependencies
- Merchant Font (To be removed)
