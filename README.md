## Overview
SApps is a suite of standalone HTML applications that can perform various tasks without external dependencies. Each app is designed to be portable, offline-friendly, and usable directly from a USB drive.

## No Frameworks, No Libraries, No Dependencies, No Problem
These applications are designed to be as lightweight as possible. They do not use any frameworks, libraries, or dependencies. They are designed to be entirely self-contained and portable. They should be able to be used on any computer, from a USB drive, and should not require any installation or configuration.

There is some customisation that can be done - but this should be a one time think and should not require any further configuration.

## Quick Start
1. Download the latest release
2. Open `SApp Home/SApp Home.html` in your browser
3. Select any app from the launcher
