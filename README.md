# Journaller

A Simple, HTML Based, Journal Entry Generator/Editor - designed to be fully featured in a single page.

## Background
I wanted to start journaling, but I didn't want to use a physical journal. I wanted to be able to export my entries to a format that I could use in other applications. I also wanted to be able to use it on my phone, so I needed it to be web based. I couldn't find anything that fit my needs, so I made my own.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release
2. Open `Journaller vx.0.html` in your browser of choice
3. Fill out the form
4. Choose your export option
5. Enjoy your exported file!

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some are necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

- FileSaver.js
- JSZip.js
- Google Material Symbols Outline
- Playfair Display Font
