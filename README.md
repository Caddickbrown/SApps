# Journaller

A Simple, HTML Based, Journal Entry Generator/Editor - designed to be fully featured in a single page.

## Background
I wanted to start journaling, but I didn't want to use a physical journal. I wanted to be able to export my entries to a format that I could use in other applications. I also wanted to be able to use it on any computer, even from a USB Drive.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release.
2. Open `Journaller vx.x.html` in your browser of choice.
3. Fill out the form.
4. Choose your export option.
5. Enjoy your exported file(s)!

## Features
- Date/Titles/Tags
- Various Export Options
- Dark/Light Mode
- Journal Prompts
- Clean Design
- 45+ Prompts

### Export Options
- CSV
- JSON
- Markdown
- Zip Folder (All of the above)
- Clipboard (In Markdown)

## Future

### Planned Functionality
- Themes

    - Benefit would be to me not typing out the titles and where they go later on
- Image Attacher
- Mood Option
    - With Tags?
- Separate Prompt section in main form with extra section exported?

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some are necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

### Current Dependencies
- FileSaver.js
- JSZip.js
- Google Material Symbols Outline Font
- Playfair Display Font
