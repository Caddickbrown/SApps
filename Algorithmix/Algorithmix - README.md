# Algorithmix

This is a mock application that is essentially an "Idea generator".

It only simple, and isn't overly sophisticated, but can generate some random ideas that can be good jumping off points.

Ideally this would be a web app - but there is a working C++ and Python version to start with.

It is designed to be a little random, and to not entirely make sense. The idea being to make the user think about how they could accomplish the task.

"You have 9 seconds to film a painting..." for instance, could mean that you have to create a 9 second film, that you have 9 seconds to put everything together, or something else entriely.

## C++
Originally created as this was the first language available to me, it could be used for embedding into a physical device.

## Python
There are three versions of the file here. All work and basically do the same thing. One is entirely self contained, one has a more easily updatable JSON file that can be used with it, and the final one is a slightly less readable, but smaller file.
