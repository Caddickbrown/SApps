# Recordr
Recordr is a simple, easy to use, and free microphone recorder for a web browser.

## Background
I wanted a way to make a quick voice recording on my computer, without having to download any software. I also wanted to be able to save the recording to my computer, so I could use it in other applications.

## Usage
- Open the SApp
- Click the Record Button
- Click the Stop Button
- Click the Download Button
- Save the file to your computer

## Features
- Record Audio

## Roadmap

### Planned Functionality
- Dark/Light Mode

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some may be necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

### Current Dependencies
- None

### Previous Dependencies
- None
