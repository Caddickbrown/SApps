# B64
B64 is a single page app that converts images into base64 strings.

## Background
I needed a way to convert images into base64 strings for use in SApp projects. I figured why not make a SApp that does it? So here we are.

## Usage


## Features
- Dark/Light Mode

## Roadmap
### v2.0
- [ ] Copy to Clipboard Notification
- [ ] SApp Template Update
- [ ] Copy to HTML Code Button

### Planned Functionality
- HTML Code Copy

## Dependencies
I try to reduce the dependencies as much as possible, but some may be necessary for the functionality of the application.

Should I find a way to remove them, I will, but for development speed they may be required in the interim.

### Current Dependencies
- None

### Previous Dependencies
-
